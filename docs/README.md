## üéØ Key Concepts & Terminology

### Processing Modes

**Batch Processing** (Default):
- Color: Green (#22C55E)
- Cost: $0.03 per book
- Time: ~24 hours
- Use case: Regular reading lists, cost-conscious users
- Savings: 50% vs expedited

**Expedited Processing**:
- Color: Amber (#F59E0B)
- Cost: $0.06 per book
- Time: ~9 minutes
- Use case: Urgent needs, time-sensitive analysis
- Premium: 2x cost for 160x speed

### Document Types

**MADHO Summary** (Primary output):
- Personal, actionable breakdown
- "Why This Matters" and "Do This Week" sections
- Target: Busy professionals

**Detailed Analysis**:
- Comprehensive chapter-by-chapter breakdown
- 7-10 paragraphs per chapter
- Target: Deep learners

**Executive Summary**:
- High-level strategic insights
- Business-focused
- Target: Leadership

**Quick Reference**:
- Key frameworks and checklists
- Scannable format
- Target: Quick lookup

### Design System

**Primary Brand**: Blue (#0EA5E9) - Trust, intelligence, primary actions
**Batch Processing**: Green (#22C55E) - Economy, savings, patience
**Expedited Processing**: Amber (#F59E0B) - Premium, urgency, speed

**Critical Rule**: Never mix processing colors. Green = batch, amber = expedited, always.
