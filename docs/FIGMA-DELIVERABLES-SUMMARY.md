## 🎨 Design System Highlights

### Color Strategy (CRITICAL)

The color system is semantic and intentional:

**Green (#22C55E) = Batch Processing**
- Represents: Economy, cost-effectiveness, patience
- Used for: Batch badges, progress bars, buttons, savings callouts
- Psychology: Green = go, savings, eco-friendly, smart choice

**Amber (#F59E0B) = Expedited Processing**
- Represents: Premium, urgency, speed
- Used for: Expedited badges, progress bars, buttons, upgrade CTAs
- Psychology: Amber = caution/attention, premium, fast

**Blue (#0EA5E9) = Primary Brand**
- Represents: Trust, intelligence, professionalism
- Used for: Primary actions, links, focus states, logo

**This distinction is non-negotiable.** Users must instantly understand:
- Green = cheaper, slower
- Amber = more expensive, faster

---

### Typography Scale

```
Heading 1:   30px / bold    (Page titles)
Heading 2:   24px / semibold (Section titles)
Heading 3:   20px / semibold (Subsections)
Body Large:  18px / normal   (Important text)
Body Base:   16px / normal   (Standard text)
Body Small:  14px / normal   (Secondary text)
Label:       14px / medium   (Form labels)
Caption:     12px / normal   (Metadata)
```

---

### Spacing System

Based on 8px grid:
```
4px  - Micro (icon-text gap)
8px  - Tight (related elements)
12px - Compact (form field spacing)
16px - Standard (component padding)
24px - Comfortable (section spacing)
32px - Spacious (major sections)
48px - Generous (page sections)
64px - Wide (hero spacing)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Trust the Prompt
The prompt is intentionally detailed (12,000 words). Don't summarize or simplify it - the detail ensures quality output.

### Tip 2: Batch vs Expedited is Everything
This visual distinction is THE core value prop. If users can't instantly see the difference, the design fails. Green = economy, Amber = premium.

### Tip 3: Use Real Data
Real book titles ("Atomic Habits" not "Book 1") make the prototype feel real. This helps stakeholders and users connect with the design.

### Tip 4: Mobile Matters
Busy executives check status on phones. Mobile layout is just as important as desktop.

### Tip 5: Accessibility is Not Optional
WCAG AA compliance is a requirement, not a nice-to-have. Build it in from the start.
