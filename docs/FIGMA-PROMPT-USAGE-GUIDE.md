## üìñ Understanding the Prompt Structure

The prompt is organized into **15 major sections**, each serving a specific purpose:

### Section Breakdown

#### 1. Product Context (üéØ)
**Purpose**: Establishes what bkrptr is and why design decisions matter

**Key Elements**:
- Product description
- Two processing modes (Batch/Expedited)
- Target users
- Value proposition

**Why It Matters**: Figma Make needs business context to make intelligent design decisions

---

#### 2. Design System Foundation (üé®)
**Purpose**: Provides exact color codes, typography, spacing - the visual DNA

**Key Elements**:
- **Color Palette**: Exact hex codes for all colors
  - Primary (Blue): #0EA5E9
  - Batch (Green): #22C55E ‚Üê Critical for cost-effective branding
  - Expedited (Amber): #F59E0B ‚Üê Critical for premium branding
  - Semantic colors (success, error, warning, info)
  - Full gray scale (50-900)

- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights, line-heights
  - System fonts for performance
  - 8 size scale (12px - 36px)
  - 4 weight options (400-700)

- **Spacing**: 8px base grid (4px - 96px)

- **Border Radius**: 4 options (4px - 9999px for pills)

- **Shadows**: 4 elevation levels + focus rings

**Why It Matters**: These exact values ensure pixel-perfect implementation. Colors are semantic - green ALWAYS means batch/economy, amber ALWAYS means expedited/premium.

## üéØ Step-by-Step Usage Instructions

### Method 1: Full Prompt (Recommended)

**Step 1: Prepare**
1. Open `FIGMA-MAKE-PROMPT.md`
2. Review the prompt to understand scope
3. Note any customizations needed (e.g., brand colors, company name)

**Step 2: Copy Prompt**
```
1. Select ALL text from "# FIGMA MAKE PROMPT: bkrptr Web Dashboard"
2. Copy to clipboard (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C)
3. Prompt is ~12,000 words - that's intentional
```

**Step 3: Paste into Figma Make**
1. Open Figma Make interface
2. Create new design project
3. Paste entire prompt into input field
4. **Do not edit or summarize** - the length provides necessary detail

**Step 5: Review**
1. Check against quality checklist (Section 13 of prompt)
2. Verify critical distinctions:
   - ‚úì Batch processing = GREEN
   - ‚úì Expedited processing = AMBER
   - ‚úì All screens present
   - ‚úì Interactive flows work

---

### Method 2: Iterative Approach (If Tool Has Limits)

Some AI design tools have input length limits. If needed:

**Iteration 1: Design System + Components**
```
Use sections:
- Product Context
- Design System Foundation
- Component Library
- Component States

Output: Complete component library with all states
```

**Iteration 2: Main Screens (Desktop)**
```
Reference: "Use design system from previous iteration"

Use sections:
- Screen 1: Dashboard
- Screen 2: New Analysis Form
- Screen 3: Detail View

Output: 3 core screens at desktop breakpoint
```

**Iteration 3: Secondary Screens + Responsive**
```
Use sections:
- Screen 4: Expedite Modal
- Screen 5: API Keys
- Screen 6: Bulk Upload
- Responsive Breakpoints

Output: Complete screen set + tablet/mobile versions
```

**Iteration 4: Interactions + Polish**
```
Use sections:
- Interactions & Animations
- Interactive Flows
- Sample Data

Output: Linked prototype with real data
```

---

### Method 3: Screen-by-Screen (Maximum Control)

For fine-tuned control, generate each screen individually:

**Template for Individual Screens**:
```
Context: [Copy Product Context section]
Design System: [Copy entire Design System Foundation]
Screen to Generate: [Copy specific screen section]
Sample Data: [Copy relevant data]

Generate: [Screen name] with all component states
```

**Example: Dashboard Only**
```
[Product Context]
[Design System Foundation]
[Screen 1: Main Dashboard specification]
[Sample Data for 11 books]

Generate the main dashboard with sidebar navigation, stats cards,
and analysis queue showing all processing states.
```

---

## üîÑ Iteration & Refinement

### Common Refinement Prompts

After initial generation, you may need to refine:

#### Refinement 1: Adjust Color Intensity

**If colors too bright/dark**:
```
The batch green (#22C55E) feels too bright.
Reduce saturation by 15% while maintaining the "economy/cost-effective" vibe.
Update all batch-related components (badges, buttons, progress bars).
```

#### Refinement 2: Adjust Spacing

**If layout feels cramped**:
```
Increase spacing between analysis cards from 16px to 24px.
Increase card internal padding from 24px to 32px.
Maintain 8px base grid throughout.
```

#### Refinement 3: Enhance Specific Component

**If status badges need work**:
```
Current status badges:
- Too small (hard to read)
- Border not visible enough

Improvements:
- Increase font size from 12px to 13px
- Increase padding from 4px 12px to 6px 14px
- Make border 1.5px instead of 1px
- Increase border radius from full pill to 6px (slightly rounded rectangle)
```

#### Refinement 4: Add Missing State

**If component missing a state**:
```
The "Expedite" button is missing a loading state.

Add loading state:
- Background: amber-500 (same as default)
- Cursor: not-allowed
- Content: Replace text with spinner (20px, amber-700)
- Opacity: 0.7
```

#### Refinement 5: Improve Contrast

**If accessibility fails**:
```
The gray-500 text on white background has 4.2:1 contrast (fails WCAG AA for small text).

Change all secondary text color from gray-500 (#6B7280) to gray-600 (#4B5563).
Verify new contrast ratio is ‚â• 4.5:1.
```

---

### Iteration Strategy

**First Pass**: Generate everything
**Second Pass**: Fix critical issues (colors, spacing, missing states)
**Third Pass**: Polish (micro-interactions, animations, edge cases)
**Fourth Pass**: Accessibility audit
**Final Pass**: Developer handoff preparation

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Colors Don't Match Spec

**Symptom**: Generated colors are close but not exact

**Solution**:
```
The primary blue should be exactly #0EA5E9, but generated design uses #1DA1F2.

Please update all instances of primary blue to #0EA5E9:
- Primary buttons
- Focus rings
- Links
- Primary-500 color style
- Logo text
```

---

### Problem: Layout Breaks on Tablet

**Symptom**: Tablet view looks squeezed or broken

**Solution**:
```
At 768px breakpoint, the 3-column stats cards don't fit.

Update tablet layout:
- Change stats cards from 3 columns to 2 columns
- Third card wraps to second row
- Maintain 24px gap between cards
- Cards should be equal width (calc(50% - 12px))
```

---

### Problem: Missing Interactive States

**Symptom**: Components only show default state

**Solution**:
```
Buttons need hover/active/focus states.

For each button type (Primary, Secondary, Batch, Expedite):
1. Create hover variant (darker background, elevated shadow)
2. Create active variant (darkest background, reduced shadow, 1px down)
3. Create focus variant (3px ring with 20% opacity)
4. Create disabled variant (gray background, no interactions)

Use component properties to switch between states.
```

---

### Problem: Sample Data is Generic

**Symptom**: Using "Book 1", "Book 2" instead of real titles

**Solution**:
```
Replace generic book titles with real examples from Section 8:

Use these 11 books:
1. "Atomic Habits" by James Clear
2. "Deep Work" by Cal Newport
3. "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman
[... list all 11 ...]

Assign realistic statuses, costs, and timestamps as specified in sample data section.
```

---

### Problem: Responsive Breakpoints Don't Work

**Symptom**: Mobile looks like squished desktop

**Solution**:
```
Mobile layout (375px) needs complete redesign, not just scaling:

Changes required:
1. Sidebar ‚Üí Hamburger menu (icon only, slides from left)
2. Stats cards ‚Üí Stack vertically (full width)
3. Analysis cards ‚Üí Compact layout:
   - Hide secondary metadata
   - Stack action buttons vertically
   - Reduce padding to 16px
4. Form ‚Üí Full width inputs, larger touch targets (44px min)
5. Processing mode cards ‚Üí Stack vertically instead of side-by-side
```

---

### Problem: Prototype Links Don't Work

**Symptom**: Clicking doesn't navigate between screens

**Solution**:
```
Set up prototype connections for these 5 flows:

Flow 1: Dashboard ‚Üí New Analysis
- Hotspot: "New Analysis" button on dashboard
- Action: Navigate to "New Analysis Form" screen
- Transition: Slide from right, 250ms

Flow 2: Expedite Modal
- Hotspot: "Expedite" button on analysis card
- Action: Open overlay "Expedite Modal"
- Transition: Fade in + scale up, 250ms

[... specify all 5 flows ...]
```

---

## üöÄ Developer Handoff

### Preparing Design for Development

Once prototype is finalized, prepare for developer handoff:

#### Step 1: Organize Figma File

**Clean up**:
- Delete unused components
- Rename layers descriptively
- Group related elements
- Lock background layers
- Add comments for complex interactions

**Structure**:
```
üìÑ Pages
  ‚îú‚îÄ üé® Design System (developer reference)
  ‚îú‚îÄ üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Screens (primary specs)
  ‚îú‚îÄ üì± Tablet (responsive reference)
  ‚îú‚îÄ üì± Mobile (responsive reference)
  ‚îú‚îÄ üé≠ Component States (implementation guide)
  ‚îî‚îÄ üîó Prototype (demo only)
```

#### Step 2: Create Developer Resources Page

Add new page: "Developer Handoff"

**Include**:

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Design System
Always generate the design system first. Having components before screens ensures consistency.

### Tip 2: Use Real Data Early
Don't wait until the end to add real book titles. Sample data makes the design feel real and helps spot layout issues.

### Tip 3: Test Accessibility from Start
Don't treat accessibility as a final check. Build it in from the beginning by verifying color contrasts and focus states early.

### Tip 4: Prototype Early
Link screens as you build them. Finding navigation issues in prototype mode is much easier than reviewing static screens.

### Tip 5: Mobile is Not Desktop Squished
Design mobile layouts from scratch. If you just scale down desktop, you'll get poor UX.

### Tip 6: Document Decisions
When you make a design decision (e.g., "made this green to indicate savings"), add a comment in Figma. Future-you will thank you.

### Tip 7: Batch vs Expedited Distinction
This is THE most important visual in the entire app. If a user can't instantly tell the difference, the design has failed. Use green/amber religiously.
